## Outline

For millennia, man has looked at the sky with wonder and amazement.  Light pollution is a recent phenomenon which has obscured mankindâ€™s access to the stars, negatively impacted wildlife, and disrupted the natural order of life.  With adjustments, humans can continue to enjoy the night sky while conserving the environment.  My data visualization will walk users through the proliferation of city lighting, the impact on life today and ultimately suggestions for how individuals can make a positive impact.


The structure of this presentation will seek to convince the reader that there is value in preserving the night sky.  The visualization will begin with a brief history lesson, detailing early exploration of the night sky from astronomers from diverse backgrounds, such as China, Italy and Britain.  Data visualizations will be in the form of drawings and mappings of the night sky.  The goal of this section is to impress the reader with an appreciation of the night sky.

In the next section, I will begin to bring in numerical data that tracks the proliferation of electricity and city lights to major European and American cities.  It will detail how different countries and populations have simultaneously gained access to electricity while at the same time losing access to the night sky due to light pollution.  This should begin to concern the reader as they realize the value they have lost as a result of living in an industrialize society.

I will continue with the negative impacts that light pollution has on several aspects of society.  Increased blue light exposure has proven detrimental to human sleep cycles.  Many believe that street lights prevent crime, but previous studies have raised questions about that conclusion.  Finally, wildlife, from sea turtles to birds, are negatively impacted by light pollution as their cycadean rhythm and navigation is disrupted.  This will be the zenith in my story arc: readers should feel a sense of concern about the problem of light pollution and be looking for solutions.

The final section will encompass my call to action.  There are many steps individuals can take to reduce light pollution and enjoy the night sky.  They can: be more conscientious about their choice of light bulbs, shield outdoor lighting fixtures, use specialized software on their devices to reduce blue light, lobby their local governments to enact lightning ordinances, and visit dark sky parks to reconnect with the night sky.

#### Data

Because this is an atypical topic, data for this project will be coming from a multitude of sources.  The first section will source star maps from China and British astronomer Edmond Halley.  The next section will look at time series data to identify how energy use and prices have changed over time.  It will also delve into urbanization and how different countries are impacted by light pollution.  Several sources may be leveraged to identify the impact of light pollution on wildlife, including a short animation that can engage the readers.  The lack of evidence of street lights on crime and the disruptiveness of blue light on human sleep cycles will further help support the impact of light pollution on the world today.  Finally, the call to action will use some suggestions from the dark sky association.  Most of these sources do not provide raw data, so I will have to extract the information manually and repurpose it for my project.

#### Method and Medium

For this project, I intend to utilize the shorthand software to build my story.  The presentation will be a combination of words, images, graphs, charts, animations and suggestions to the reader.  I hope to keep the amount of text to a minimum so the reader can experience the story through the images and the data.  This should help keep the visualization fresh and easily accessible.  The user will scroll through the story arc that I described above, leaving with a sense of purpose and newfound interest in the night sky.
