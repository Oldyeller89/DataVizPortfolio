## High Level Project Summary

This project was an opportunity to practice the design and data visualization skills learned in my CMU course.  The core goal of the project is to communicate a story regarding light pollution to my audience using data.

## Outline

For millennia, man has looked at the sky with wonder and amazement.  Light pollution is a recent phenomenon which has obscured mankind’s access to the stars, negatively impacted wildlife, and disrupted the natural order of life.  With adjustments, humans can continue to enjoy the night sky while conserving the environment.  My data visualization will walk users through the proliferation of city lighting, the impact on life today and ultimately suggestions for how individuals can make a positive impact.

The structure of this presentation will seek to convince the reader that there is value in preserving the night sky.  The visualization will begin with a brief history lesson, detailing early exploration of the night sky from astronomers from diverse backgrounds, such as China, Italy and Britain.  Data visualizations will be in the form of drawings and mappings of the night sky.  The goal of this section is to impress the reader with an appreciation of the night sky.

In the next section, I will begin to bring in numerical data that tracks the proliferation of electricity and city lights to major European and American cities.  It will detail how different countries and populations have simultaneously gained access to electricity while at the same time losing access to the night sky due to light pollution.  This should begin to concern the reader as they realize the value they have lost as a result of living in an industrialize society.

I will continue with the negative impacts that light pollution has on several aspects of society.  Increased blue light exposure has proven detrimental to human sleep cycles.  Many believe that street lights prevent crime, but previous studies have raised questions about that conclusion.  Finally, wildlife, from sea turtles to birds, are negatively impacted by light pollution as their cycadean rhythm and navigation is disrupted.  This will be the zenith in my story arc: readers should feel a sense of concern about the problem of light pollution and be looking for solutions.

The final section will encompass my call to action.  There are many steps individuals can take to reduce light pollution and enjoy the night sky.  They can: be more conscientious about their choice of light bulbs, shield outdoor lighting fixtures, use specialized software on their devices to reduce blue light, lobby their local governments to enact lightning ordinances, and visit dark sky parks to reconnect with the night sky.

## Data

Because this is an atypical topic, data for this project will be coming from a multitude of sources.  The first section will source star maps from [China](https://gizmodo.com/how-ancient-star-maps-gave-rise-to-modern-astronomy-1818815391) and British astronomer [Edmond Halley](http://s3.amazonaws.com/magnoliasoft.imageweb/nmm/supersize/b4225.jpg).  The next section will look at [time series](https://www.pressestelle.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/a70100710/Medieninformationen/2007/Pearson_and_Fouquet_7_Centuries_Light_En_Jnl_2006v27-01-a07.pdf) data to identify how energy use and prices have changed over time.  It will also delve into [urbanization](https://ourworldindata.org/urbanization) and how [different countries](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/6/e1600377/tab-figures-data) are impacted by light pollution.  [Several](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4778446/) [sources](http://cescos.fau.edu/observatory/lightpol-Birds.html) may be leveraged to identify the impact of light pollution on wildlife, including a short [animation](http://www.tourdeturtles.org/flash/LightPollution.swf) that can engage the readers.  The lack of evidence of street lights on [crime](https://jech.bmj.com/content/69/11/1118) and the disruptiveness of blue light on human [sleep cycles](https://www.darksky.org/ama-report-affirms-human-health-impacts-from-leds/) will further help support the impact of light pollution on the world today.  Finally, the call to action will use some suggestions from the [dark sky association](https://www.darksky.org/get-involved/).  Most of these sources do not provide raw data, so I will have to extract the information manually and repurpose it for my project.

## Method and Medium

For this project, I intend to utilize the shorthand software to build my story.  The presentation will be a combination of words, images, graphs, charts, animations and suggestions to the reader.  I hope to keep the amount of text to a minimum so the reader can experience the story through the images and the data.  This should help keep the visualization fresh and easily accessible.  The user will scroll through the story arc that I described above, leaving with a sense of purpose and newfound interest in the night sky.  

## First Draft Sketches

![Sketches](https://github.com/Oldyeller89/DataVizPortfolio/blob/master/ProjectPart1Sketches/SCN_0008.pdf)

## User Research Protocol

1.	Describe what I hope to find during interviews

    a.	Reaction to the design and layout of the presentation
    
    b.	Whether the storyboard flows and maintains a consistent tone.
    
    c.	Whether the user can identify the core goal of the storyboard.
    
    d.	Whether the background graphics are setting the right tone
    
    e.	If the data visualizations are appropriate to the story or if there are pieces of information they would like to know about that are missing.
    
    f.	If the data visualizations are clear and the takeaways easy to extract.
    
2.	Identify the target audience

    a.	I believe the target audience are younger individuals who are not aware of the majesty of the night sky and take artificial light for granted.
    
3.	My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview.

    a.	Fortunately, we are at a University and thus I feel it will be easy to identify individuals who have been citybound for most of their life and will be able to provide feedback on my story.
    
## Interview Questions 

1.	Please review my storyboard all the way through and then we can discuss your thoughts on the following topics.
2.	What do you think is the core objective of this storyboard?
3.	Is the message consistent throughout, or does the tone change?
4.	Are there any messages or actions you have been able to take away from this?
5.	Please describe your thoughts about the design and the layout of the storyboard.
6.	Specifically regarding the data visualizations, to what level did they contribute to the story?
7.	Were the data visualizations clear?  If not, what would you change?
8.	Were there any pieces of information which you felt were missing from the storyboard?
9.	Please provide any additional feedback you may have.

## Interview Findings

Interviewee #1
1.	First Impressions

    a.	Impressive statistics and story.  This is a topic I didn’t know much about before.
    
2.	Core objective of the storyboard

    a.	To inform me of a problem.  That light pollution is an issue and there are steps I can take to prevent it, help the world and my own health.
    
3.	Was the messaging consistent?

    a.	Yes, I felt it was.  There was some history up-front and then some more modern discussion of the topic.  However, I felt that I would have gotten the same result if the history wasn’t there.  For those with less time, it may not be necessary.
    
4.	Was the Layout appropriate?

    a.	It made sense to me and seemed to work.  However, the graphs were too small.
5.	Did the Data Visualizations contribute to the story?  

    a.	The charts were generally too small.  They helped the story.  I felt you could go a bit deeper on the eBook data.  The REM sleep chart didn’t seem to be that different to me, so maybe highlight the difference in eBook vs. paperback.
    
6.	Were the Data Visualizations clear?
    
    a.	The map at the end was not super clear what I was looking at.  Make it clearer that these are national parks / places to go to see the night sky.
    
    b.	The donut colors could be adjusted
    
7.	Was there any Missing information you would like to see?

    a.	You mentioned cancer as a health impact, so I might want to see the data behind that.
    
8.	Any other feedback?

    a.	Can you make any predictions?
    
Interviewee #2
1.	First Impressions

    a.	Overall I liked it, thought it told a good story
    
2.	Core objective of the storyboard

    a.	I thought the goal was to raise awareness about the growth of light pollution and its effects.
    
3.	Was the messaging consistent?

    a.	I think I missed the transitions a bit between history to modern day as well as the transition from wildlife impacts to human impacts.  You could make that a bit more explicit.
    
4.	Was the Layout appropriate?

    a.	I liked the dark theme and the changes in pictures.  
    
    b.  Perhaps don't have all of the text on the left hand side.
    
5.	Did the Data Visualizations contribute to the story? 

    a.	Overall I felt they were great.
    
    b.  I felt the arrow chart was very clear and powerful.
    
6.	Were the Data Visualizations clear?

    a.	Some of the colors were inconsistent betwen charts.
    
    b.	For the time series charts, it might help to make it more apparent that they don't cover the same time periods.
    
    c.  Make the text bigger in the charts.
    
    d.  I found the rose chart a bit confusing/busy.
    
7.	Was there any Missing information you would like to see?

    a.	No.  There was good context and action items.
    
8.	Any other feedback?

    a.	Nope.

Interviewee #3
1.	First Impressions

    a.	Overall liked it a lot.  Good start: visual/impactful.  Felt like there were specific sections (History...)  Jumpy to wildlife and then to human health.  Header would help.  Maybe have everything fade or everything be its own block.  Pictures jumpy.
    
2.	Core objective of the storyboard

    a.	Get people to reduce their light usage at night
    
3.	Was the messaging consistent?

    a.	Yes, definitely.
    b.  The cartoony picture didn't fit.
    
4.	Was the Layout appropriate?

    a.	Layout was conducive, particularly the intro.  See earlier comments about jumping between sections.
    
5.	Did the Data Visualizations contribute to the story?  

    a.	Yes.
    
6.	Were the Data Visualizations clear?

    a.  Can I make them bigger.  Hard to figure out with text size.  Particularly 2 time series charts.
    
7.	Was there any Missing information you would like to see?

    a.	Weight distribution on the early stuff felt a bit heavy vs. current impacts.  Maybe cut the 2nd history image.
    
8.	Any other feedback?

    a.	The map chart at the end.  Can you put in the Tableau interactive piece?

## Changes Implemented

1. Edited the charts to make the font larger and more readable.  Unfortunately shorthand doesn't permit me more space to enlarge the charts.

2. Edited the timeline charts to make it clearer that these are sequential / not the exact same time periods.

3. Cut out the 2nd history image and reduced the text so as to have a better balance in the overall presentation.

4. Added headers / clearer separations of the sections.

5. Adjusted the format of the presentation so that the sections flowed into each other smoothly.

6. Adjusted the donut chart colors.

## Changes Implemented (Round 2)

1. Fixed Citations

2. Removed some charts that were confusing (e.g. Rose Plot) and replaced others that could be better displayed (e.g. Donut Chart).

3. Adjusted the presentation of the Tableau map at the end so it is interactive and highlights the PA park.

4. Reorganized the flow of the story so some charts are visible on the full screen to allow for easier reading.

5. Adjusted/added some background images.

## Intended Audience

The intended audience for this presentation is younger individuals who are not aware of the majesty of the night sky.  They likely are unaware of artificial light as a problem and simply see it as part of their everyday life. These individuals may be interested in environmental issues, such as climate change, and are thus likely receptive to this new information.  Specifically, I will be presenting to my CMU class in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania.  Because of this, I can personalize some of the images and recommendations to this region.

## Work Summary

This project took place in three phases.  Phase 1 included the project outline, which created the structure for the storyboard.  In this phase, I also acquired my reference sources, datasets, and images.  Preliminary sketches of the storyboard provided an early view into the structure and narrative of the project.

In Phase 2, I constructed the majority of the final deliverable using Shorthand.  This included short descriptive text, the extraction of data from my primary sources, the creation of the data visualizations, and the organization of the storyboard.  This first draft was used to conduct user research and compile feedback.  

In the third phase, the user and instructor feedback was incorporated back into the storyboard.  Final adjustments were made and the storyboard was published.  This step also included cleaning up this github page and providing a comprehensive summary of each phase of the project.

A few key takeaways from this project include:

1. The 'less is more' concept.  I often tried to fit a lot on the page by providing a lot of different charts and visualizations.  This can overwhelm the reader.  As such, I cut some visualizations out, even ones I spent hours creating (e.g Rose plot) due to the complexity and the relative value added.

2. Color Design was something I had not considered thoroughly before this project.  Given the theme (light pollution), I tried to keep my color pallette dark and use images that supported my narrative.

3. While we were introduced to a number of data visualization tools during the semester (e.g. DataWrapper, RawGraphs), I felt these tools to be cumbersome, restrictive, and insufficient to accomplish what I envisioned.  In the end, I found the most flexibility and ability working in either Excel or Python.
