# Daniel Lesser Data Visualization Portfolio
Carnegie Mellon University - Telling Stories with Data 94-870

Summer 2019

## About Me

My name is Daniel Lesser and I am currently pursuing my Master's in Information Systems - Business Intelligence and Data Analytics.  I plan to graduate in August 2019 and have recently accepted a job at Bose to do market intelligence research on the automotive and audio industries.  

I have seven years of experience in market research, covering the tech and CPG industries.  My clients have included equity investors, branded vendors, white box manufacturers, component suppliers, grocery stores, credit card companies, and packaged food suppliers. In my previous roles, I have built many slidedecks and written research reports with graphs.  Part of my goal was to communicate technical findings to a non-technical audience.

## What I hope to Learn

I am passionate about exploring data and informing business decision making through research.  In this course, I hope to find go-to methods and tools that I can leverage when displaying my findings to clients and managers.  I am confident in my spoken presentation skills, but not my 'powerpoint' presentation skills.  I feel I overwhelm pages with too much text and not enough aesthetically pleasing design.  I hope to find ways to display data and stories that are convincing.  I hope to also understand typical pitfalls of data visualization.  I plan to directly apply my learnings from this class to my next role.

### Assignment 1: Visualizing British Politics

Revised Graph:  I feel this graph is a slight improvement vs. the original, though there are a few things I would still change given the opportunity.  

  1) I would focus the data more on change in 'likes' rather than looking at a static point in time. 
  
  2) I would like to have a comparison of the Labour metrics + Corbyn against other political parties and leaders in Britain.
  
  3) I would consider including other social platforms and/or approval ratings to measure popularity.

### Assignment 2: OIG Newspaper Version

For this version of the Office of Inspector General report, I took on the role of a reporter writing for a newspaper.  My target audience is a left-leaning citizen who is a typical reader of outlets like CNN or MSNBC.  My goal is to communicate the human crisis currently taking place at the southern border.  Rather than focus on the absolute numbers, which may be dehumanizing, I chose to focus on percentages and ratios.  I wanted to highlight the plight that children and families are facing more than single adults.

To accomplish this, I created two visualizations based on the data in the report.  The first shows the change in the proportion of apprehensions that were children or families in the past year.  I use grey to de-emphasize the adults, while using a darker, but 'safe' blue color to highlight the children and families.  In the second chart, I again use grey for those who are detained less than 72 hours in order to bring attention to those who are detained for long periods of time.  I use a darker red color to indicate that this is an issue of poor treatment.  I try and keep the graphics simple and text minimal in order to drive home the takeaway that things are getting worse for children and family migrants at the border.

### Assignment 2: OIG DHS Analyst Report Version

For this version of the Office of Inspector General report, I took on the role of an analyst who would support the compilation of the report itself.  My goal here was to highlight the critical nature of the issue and encourage action by those in power.  I focus more on the high-level issues rather than the personal plights of individuals.  

In order to do this, I split the visualization into two parts.  The bar chart at the top aims to highlight that there is a sharp increase in the number of apprehensions at the southern border, driven mostly by family migrants.  The focus should be on the current year (darker shade) and the increase vs. the prior year.  I also wanted to show in the subtitle that this issue is not simply an apprehension issue, but that it is exacerbated by the inability of the CBP to transfer detainees.  That is where the second half of the graphic comes in.  It displays in simple terms that the stations are overcrowded, have prolonged detentions and that immigration officials are overwhelmed and underfunded.  I feel the iconography may be a bit too 'colorful' for an official document, but I did want to highlight some of the high-level simple metrics from the report.
