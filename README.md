# Daniel Lesser Data Visualization Portfolio
Carnegie Mellon University - Telling Stories with Data 94-870

Summer 2019

## About Me

My name is Daniel Lesser and I am currently pursuing my Master's in Information Systems - Business Intelligence and Data Analytics.  I plan to graduate in August 2019 and have recently accepted a job at Bose to do market intelligence research on the automotive and audio industries.  

I have seven years of experience in market research, covering the tech and CPG industries.  My clients have included equity investors, branded vendors, white box manufacturers, component suppliers, grocery stores, credit card companies, and packaged food suppliers. In my previous roles, I have built many slidedecks and written research reports with graphs.  Part of my goal was to communicate technical findings to a non-technical audience.

## What I hope to Learn

I am passionate about exploring data and informing business decision making through research.  In this course, I hope to find go-to methods and tools that I can leverage when displaying my findings to clients and managers.  I am confident in my spoken presentation skills, but not my 'powerpoint' presentation skills.  I feel I overwhelm pages with too much text and not enough aesthetically pleasing design.  I hope to find ways to display data and stories that are convincing.  I hope to also understand typical pitfalls of data visualization.  I plan to directly apply my learnings from this class to my next role.
