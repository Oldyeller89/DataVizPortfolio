# Daniel Lesser Data Visualization Portfolio
Carnegie Mellon University - Telling Stories with Data 94-870

Summer 2019

## About Me

My name is Daniel Lesser and I am currently pursuing my Master's in Information Systems - Business Intelligence and Data Analytics.  I plan to graduate in August 2019 and have recently accepted a job at Bose to do market intelligence research on the automotive and audio industries.  

I have seven years of experience in market research, covering the tech and CPG industries.  My clients have included equity investors, branded vendors, white box manufacturers, component suppliers, grocery stores, credit card companies, and packaged food suppliers. In my previous roles, I have built many slidedecks and written research reports with graphs.  Part of my goal was to communicate technical findings to a non-technical audience.

## What I hope to Learn

I am passionate about exploring data and informing business decision making through research.  In this course, I hope to find go-to methods and tools that I can leverage when displaying my findings to clients and managers.  I am confident in my spoken presentation skills, but not my 'powerpoint' presentation skills.  I feel I overwhelm pages with too much text and not enough aesthetically pleasing design.  I hope to find ways to display data and stories that are convincing.  I hope to also understand typical pitfalls of data visualization.  I plan to directly apply my learnings from this class to my next role.

### Assignment 1: Visualizing British Politics

<iframe title="Labour Party Moving Left" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-m9N9s" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/m9N9s/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="265"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>

Revised Graph:  I feel this graph is a slight improvement vs. the original, though there are a few things I would still change given the opportunity.  

  1) I would focus the data more on change in 'likes' rather than looking at a static point in time. 
  
  2) I would like to have a comparison of the Labour metrics + Corbyn against other political parties and leaders in Britain.
  
  3) I would consider including other social platforms and/or approval ratings to measure popularity.

### Assignment 2: OIG Newspaper Version

For this version of the Office of Inspector General report, I took on the role of a reporter writing for a newspaper.  My target audience is a left-leaning citizen who is a typical reader of outlets like CNN or MSNBC.  My goal is to communicate the human crisis currently taking place at the southern border.  Rather than focus on the absolute numbers, which may be dehumanizing, I chose to focus on percentages and ratios.  I wanted to highlight the plight that children and families are facing more than single adults.

To accomplish this, I created two visualizations based on the data in the report.  The first shows the change in the proportion of apprehensions that were children or families in the past year.  I use grey to de-emphasize the adults, while using a darker, but 'safe' blue color to highlight the children and families.  In the second chart, I again use grey for those who are detained less than 72 hours in order to bring attention to those who are detained for long periods of time.  I use a darker red color to indicate that this is an issue of poor treatment.  I try and keep the graphics simple and text minimal in order to drive home the takeaway that things are getting worse for children and family migrants at the border.

### Assignment 2: OIG DHS Analyst Report Version

For this version of the Office of Inspector General report, I took on the role of an analyst who would support the compilation of the report itself.  My goal here was to highlight the critical nature of the issue and encourage action by those in power.  I focus more on the high-level issues rather than the personal plights of individuals.  

In order to do this, I split the visualization into two parts.  The bar chart at the top aims to highlight that there is a sharp increase in the number of apprehensions at the southern border, driven mostly by family migrants.  The focus should be on the current year (darker shade) and the increase vs. the prior year.  I also wanted to show in the subtitle that this issue is not simply an apprehension issue, but that it is exacerbated by the inability of the CBP to transfer detainees.  That is where the second half of the graphic comes in.  It displays in simple terms that the stations are overcrowded, have prolonged detentions and that immigration officials are overwhelmed and underfunded.  I feel the iconography may be a bit too 'colorful' for an official document, but I did want to highlight some of the high-level simple metrics from the report.

### Assignment 2: Data Visualization Critique #2

![Original Graphic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oldyeller89/DataVizPortfolio/master/pregnancy_original.jpg)

My Comments:

The intended audience for this chart is not explicit, but given it was produced by the Associated Press, I imagine it was meant to serve a typical reader of news articles found on platforms like USA Today or CNN.com.  The goal is to provide the reader with an update on a new federal report regarding pregnancy-related deaths.  It is not clear why this information is valuable, but the author has chosen to focus on Blacks, who appear to be more affected than other groups.

Overall, I would score this chart at a 6 on the usefulness scale.  It accomplishes its primary goal to show that Blacks are at greater risk of pregnancy deaths than other groups, but it fails on several other measures.  First, the title also tries to say that pregnancy-related deaths are rising, but there is no indication of time series or comparisons made in this chart.  In addition, there is data regarding age, but no reference is made to it or explanation why this information is important.  I am sure there is a lot of available data and it is unclear why these two sets were chosen and aggregated over a 4 year period.

The chart fails to address one key aspect of the title: that pregnancy-related deaths are rising.  By showing a static point in time, no trend is apparent.  We need to see change over time in order to validate the title and provide valid comparisons.  It also arguably includes more data than is necessary (deaths by age group).

If the reader only pays attention to the bars, they will get the general takeaway of the chart: that Blacks and older individuals are at greater risk.  However, the data is distorted and poorly organized.  The order of races in the top chart have no clear reasoning.  They are not ordered alphabetically, by number of deaths or by rate of deaths.  The second chart has its sections organized reasonably, but the scales are completely different than the first chart.  As a reader, I would expect to be able to compare the bars in the two charts as they are right next to each other.  Finally, the colors are a bit too close to each other (both blue/green and the gradient of the highlighted item versus the remainder).

Although the scales between the two charts (Race/Age) are inconsistent and give an inaccurate comparison, the overall chart is not too misleading.  The ratios across races are accurate and truthfully tell the reader that Blacks are more affected to pregnancy-related deaths than other races.  The same is the case for individuals over 40.

The form of the data visualization (bar chart) is very typical and easy to understand.  The reader doesn’t even really need to read the numbers to get the information.  I don’t feel the inconsistent scales are too big of a hindrance to the intuitiveness of the chart, though it would help to have consistency.

I would say the chart’s aesthetics are average.  Its simplicity means that it is unlikely to be beautiful, but at the same time it is something everyone can expect and thus not too ugly.  I don’t love the color scheme (blue/green for the two charts as well as the gradient scale), so I think that is one area for improvement.  The grey shading and darker black text for the important subjects is important.  I like the title/subtitle format.

I think a very specific audience (those affected by pregnancy) are likely to be drawn into the data which makes it seem like a big issue, particularly for Blacks and older individuals.  This may inspire more dialogue on the issue as the chart is easily accessible.  However, it doesn’t show a lot and a bit more context may help drive engagement.
